# Generic Word Game

Misc edits based off http://genericwordgame.com/

## Usage

1. Open `Generic-Word-Game.htm`

2. To create a new puzzle, use the top right buttons.

    - `New Puzzle` creates a puzzle based on randomized letters that form a word. It guarantees at least one pangram (word where all letters are used).

    - `New Random Puzzle` creates a puzzle from entirely random letters. No guarantees are made for these puzzles. Some random puzzles do not contain any words.

    - `New Custom Puzzle` allows for configuring various parameters to generate a puzzle based off of.

## Warning

This is packed react code. I did not write this or compile it. My edits are small hacks that did not require any major changes.

If you intend to do any serious development I recommend unpacking it and properly setting it up. I have left in the source maps.
